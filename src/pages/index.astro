          Debates around the rights of nature and environmental personhood 
          increasingly turn on the preposition of representation: whether we 
          speak about, for, or with non-human entities. Recent work on 
          relational representation, for instance, argues that speaking with 
          rivers or waterways requires an ongoing, situated relation rather than 
          a purely symbolic proxy. Yet even in these more advanced 
          eco-juridical models, the figure of the human representative remains 
          largely taken for granted: a bounded individual presumed capable of 
          "hosting" more-than-human perspectives without much attention to 
          how such a capacity is formed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This research starts from that gap. Before representation comes the 
          formation of the representer. What kind of human subjectivity, 
          sensorium, and relational disposition is needed for more-than-human 
          (MOTH) beings to be intentionally and imaginally included in 
          decision-making at all?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Answering this questions requires a shift in how we understand 
          continuum and threshold in human–MOTH relations. Drawing from 
          Luigina Mortari's idea of nature as a non-given that demands an open, 
          generative encounter, and from agro-pastoral "grammars of 
          cohabitation" in the Mediterranean (Enzo Bianchi), the project treats 
          care as participation in a socio-ecological continuum that links bodies, 
          ancestors, landscapes, and futures. In dialogue with Descola's

          typology of ontologies and Viveiros de Castro's contrast between 
          "making souls" and "making bodies," this continuum is not only 
          ecological but also socio-spiritual and political.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Design for the Continuum proposes a pre-deliberative, 
          pre-representational response to this condition: somatic dramaturgies 
          that work in the space of metaxy, staging thresholds as permeable 
          zones where new relations to the continuum can be rehearsed. 
          Through somatic, sonic and relational exercises—many of them 
          emerging from Mediterranean "continuum communities" and then 
          re-framed within design education—the project explores how 
          designers, guardians and civic actors can be trained to perceive 
          themselves less as autonomous individuals and more as dividual 
          nodes in a wider ecology of care.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In this sense, the research is situated between design pedagogy and 
          emerging experiments in design-for-MOTH-governance. Its central 
          question is whether design can be reimagined as the formation of 
          bodies capable of co-regulating with the living world, so that future 
          practices of representation do not merely speak for nature, but 
          emerge from lives already entangled with it.

            By re-enchantment I refer not to a nostalgic return to "magic," but to
            contemporary efforts to counter Weberian "disenchantment" by resto-
            ring a felt sense of liveliness, relationality, and mystery in human–world
            relations without abandoning critical thought. Scholars in environmen-
            tal humanities describe re-enchantment as a way of unsettling modern
            notions of a dead, mute world, foregrounding instead the affective and
            ethical force of vibrant, more-than-human ecologies.

            Ecopedagogy names a strand of critical pedagogy (rooted in Paulo
            Freire) that links environmental and social justice, treating education as
            a space to read and transform the connections between ecological de-
            struction, oppression, and global inequalities. Greg Misiaszek, for in-
            stance, defines ecopedagogy as a Freirean, dialogical approach that
            cultivates critical ecoliteracy oriented toward planetary justice and the
            disruption of anthropocentric, neoliberal forms of violence.

          A dividual voice, in anthropological terms, is a self constituted less
          as indivisible unit—person as metaphysically "cut from other,"
          point-like site of intention—and more as a relational, permeable node
          that draws its identity from ongoing exchanges with others and the
          more-than-human environment. As Marilyn Strathern puts it, a dividual
          self is dissoluble—its qualities may be distributed via modes, goods,
          and exchanges among others in the extended network.
        </p>
        <p>
          To speak of dividual voice, then, is to reimagine the person whose voice
          does not so much originate as flow through—a voice permeated by
          spirits, kin, landscapes, co-dwellers—a mode of vocalization
          that may be describing the authorship by others, spirits, ancestors and
          other-than-humans.
