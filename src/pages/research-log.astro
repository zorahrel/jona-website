                The masterclass is led by teachers from different regions of
                Southern Italy (Puglia, Sicily, Campania), who will guide
                participants through the women's vocal and percussion repertoire
                of the South, and into the relationship between body movement
                and frame drum, drawing on techniques of the ancient Greek
                chorus and its rhythmic–choral movement in space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting from the dynamics of the percussion circle, the work
                expands into movement through space, exploring how bodies and
                sounds relate physically and rhythmically in lines and ranks,
                and then in more complex formations such as diamonds, flocks,
                and packs. The chorus gradually becomes three-dimensional,
                opening toward the outside and engaging with its surroundings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through choral movement, traditional singing, and percussion,
                participants will work on homophony/unison and vocal and
                percussive polyrhythms; on the voice as it is tied to gesture
                and movement; and on the drum as both musical and expressive
                instrument. Attention will be given to coordination between BODY
                movement, rhythm on the DRUM, and VOICE, to converging and
                diverging rhythms and movements, on- and off-beat patterns,
                pauses, doubled and halved tempos, basic pulse and rhythmic
                cells, and meters in 2, in 3, and their combinations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drawing on each participant's skills and capacities, the
                masterclass encourages group-based artistic creation, helping
                everyone to engage with and gradually master the mechanisms of
                collective performance.
